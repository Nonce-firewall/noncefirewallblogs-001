      <p>Writing clean, readable code is one of the most important skills a developer can master. Clean code not only makes your applications more maintainable but also makes collaboration with other developers much smoother.</p>
      
      <h2>Principles of Clean Code</h2>
      <p>Clean code follows several key principles: it should be readable, simple, and focused. Each function should do one thing well, and variable names should clearly express their purpose.</p>
      
      <h2>Code Organization</h2>
      <p>Proper code organization is crucial for maintaining large codebases. This includes logical file structure, consistent naming conventions, and proper separation of concerns.</p>
